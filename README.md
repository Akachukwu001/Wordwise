# **WordWise: Intelligent Word Manager**

## **Description**
WordWise is an advanced word management system designed to simplify word storage, retrieval, and intelligent autocompletion. Built using **C++**, the system leverages the power of **Trie** and **Hash Table** data structures to deliver lightning-fast performance and an intuitive user experience. WordWise draws inspiration from popular text editors like **VS Code** and search engines, making it a practical tool for developers, writers, and researchers.

## **Features**
- **Efficient Word Storage**: Stores and organizes words for fast access and easy management.
- **Intelligent Autocompletion**: Provides real-time suggestions for partially entered words, improving productivity and reducing typing errors.
- **Search Functionality**: Enables users to search for words or patterns quickly using optimized data structures.
- **Interactive GUI**: Features a user-friendly graphical interface for seamless interaction.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Data Structures**: Trie, Hash Table  
- **GUI Library**: (Specify the library used for GUI, e.g., Qt or custom implementation)  

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Trie Implementation**:
   - Each word is stored as a path in the Trie, ensuring efficient memory usage and quick word lookups.
   - Supports autocompletion by traversing nodes corresponding to the input prefix.

2. **Hash Table Integration**:
   - Hash Tables provide fast access to frequently used words.
   - Complements the Trie for optimized storage and retrieval.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - The GUI allows users to type words, view autocompletion suggestions, and manage their word list with a few clicks.

---

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A GUI library or framework installed (e.g., Qt or SFML, if applicable)


---

## **Usage**
1. Open the program through the GUI or terminal.
2. Add words to the system manually or by uploading a word list.
3. Start typing a word, and the intelligent autocompletion feature will suggest possible matches.
4. Use the search functionality to locate specific words or patterns.

## **Example**
### Input:
- Word list: `apple`, `application`, `apply`, `appetite`, `banana`, `band`, `banner`
- User types: `app`

### Output:
- Autocompletion suggestions: `apple`, `application`, `apply`, `appetite`

## **Project Structure**
- **main.cpp**: Contains the main logic and integrates all components.
- **trie.cpp**: Implementation of the Trie data structure.
- **hashtable.cpp**: Implementation of the Hash Table for efficient word lookup.
- **gui.cpp** (if applicable): Handles graphical user interface interactions.
- **wordlist.txt**: A sample word list for testing.

---

## **Learning Outcomes**
- Gained hands-on experience with advanced data structures like Trie and Hash Table.
- Developed skills in GUI design for interactive applications.
- Explored the practical applications of autocomplete functionality in software tools.
- Improved understanding of efficient word management algorithms.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Add support for multi-language word management.
- Enhance the GUI with modern styling and additional features like drag-and-drop word list import.
- Optimize the system for handling large datasets with millions of words.
- Implement cloud storage for synchronized word management across devices.
